Max Goldstein Portfolio

Intro:
 
I created this project as an assignment but quickly made it my own. This website is my own personal portfolio. It has a short bio, a portfolio page that will soon be filled with many projects and assignments. And a contact page that is not yet functional but soon will be so that friends, family, future employers and colleagues can contact me.
 
I created the website to function and look the way it does because it has my own personal style with the white and gray color scheme with the mountains as the background. I was able to create this web application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and bootswatch. Now that I have built this portfolio I have a place to display my work and look more professional to future employers. I learned many new things while creating this webpage as it was my first from scratch.
 
Portfolio Build:
 
To build this website I first created a repository on github and cloned it on to my computer. From there I created an index.html page, contact.html page, a portfolio.html page and a css page. The first thing I had to learn was to create a nav bar that is aligned on the right, I achieved this look by using auto margin left in bootstrap, from there my next challenge was setting a background image in the css document and then created a container that was filled with a color so that the text look clearer using bootstrap. Another challenge that I faced was the footer, I spent a few hours trying to figure out how to get it placed at the bottom of the page when I remembered I needed to give it a fixed-bottom.
 
On the contact page I learned how to create a form using bootstrap and editing the code they give you to fit what I wanted for this website. I learned to achieve this look I needed to use sub rows and columns for each input so that the name of the field was displayed above the input.
 
The final challenge that I faced was on the portfolio page and getting the cards to be responsive when minimizing the page or using a mobile application. I achieved this by giving all rows the md-6 attribute and they all look great as the page is minimized. Also once I created the container I noticed there was not a gap with the header to in my css sheet I adding bottom-padding 70px.
